# Deploy Tenant Manager

## Overview

The Aqua Tenant Manager is an optional application that allows creating security policies and distribute them to multiple domains (groups) of these instances (tenants). This ensures uniformity in the application of all security policies, or those that are selected, across the organization.

The Tenant Manager is a web-based application with a simple, intuitive user interface (UI). This enables a single administrator to maintain enterprise's security policies quite easily.
