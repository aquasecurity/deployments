# Aqua Security Deployments and Integrations

This is the repository for [Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com) product deployments and integrations.

## Deployment of Aqua Cloud Native Security Platform (CSP)

[Aqua CSP](https://www.aquasec.com/products/aqua-cloud-native-security-platform/) is a layered, full-lifecycle cloud native aecurity platform that secures containerized, serverless and VM-based applications, from CI/CD pipelines to production runtime environments. Aqua CSP runs on-prem or in the cloud, at any scale.

## CI Plugins

* **Bamboo** - [*Aqua Security Scanner Bamboo*](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1216895/container-security?hosting=server&tab=overview) - Vulnerability scanner for container images for Atlassian Bamboo.
* **CircleCI** - [*CircleCI Orb MicroScanner*](https://github.com/aquasecurity/circleci-orb-microscanner) - Enables scanning of Docker builds in CircleCi for OS package vulnerabilities.
* **Jenkins** - [*Aqua Security Scanner Jenkins Plugin*](https://github.com/jenkinsci/aqua-security-scanner-plugin) - Adds a Build Step for scanning Docker images, local or hosted on registries, for security vulnerabilities, using the API provided by Aqua Security.
* **Microsoft VSTS** - [*Container Security For VSTS*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aquasec.aquasec) - Microsoft VSTS users can integrate with Aqua’s continuous image assurance, which is the most comprehensive, automated solution on the market for scanning and locking down container images, with deep scanning of container layers for vulnerabilities, and persistent controls to assure image integrity throughout its lifecycle.

## Open Source Tools

* [**Kube-Bench**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) - [Kube-Bench](https://blog.aquasec.com/announcing-kube-bench-an-open-source-tool-for-running-kubernetes-cis-benchmark-tests) is a Go application that runs the [CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/). You can run it on each of your nodes to compare your deployment with the best-practices security guidelines from the CIS community.
* [**Kube-hunter**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter) - [Kube-hunter](https://blog.aquasec.com/kube-hunter-kubernetes-penetration-testing) probes your Kubernetes cluster for security issues; it's like automated penetration testing.
* [**MicroScanner**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner) - The [MicroScanner](https://blog.aquasec.com/microscanner-free-image-vulnerability-scanner-for-developers) scans your container images for package vulnerabilities. The MicroScanner uses the same vulnerability database as Aqua Security’s best-in-class commercial scanner, so you get top-notch results.
