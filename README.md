# Aqua Product Deployment

## Overview

[Aqua Platform](https://www.aquasec.com/aqua-cloud-native-security-platform/) is a layered, full-lifecycle cloud native security platform that secures containerized, serverless, and VM-based applications, from application build, infrastructure through production runtime environments. Aqua runs either in SaaS or Self-Hosted Enterprise edition, at any scale.

 This is the repository explains different methods to deploy each Aqua components. It also provides a [quick_start](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/quick_start) deployment suited for proofs-of-concept (POCs), training, and test environemnts.

 Aqua components can be deployed on multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, AWS ECS, OpenShift, no-orchestrator, and more, using different deployment methods such as manifests, Helm, Operator, proprietary CLI tools, RPM, and scripts. Deployment resources for each Aqua component is listed in the respective directory.

### Aqua SaaS edition deployment

Users working with Aqua SaaS edition don't need to deploy Aqua server in their datacenter but only the relevant Enforcers to enable runtime protection. Following are the components that are available for Aqua SaaS users:
* [Enforcers](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/enforcers):  
  * **Aqua Enforcer**: containers and host protection
  * **Kube-Enforcer**: full stack Kubernetes cluster protection 
  * **VM Enforcer**: VM workloads protection
  * **MicroEnforcer**: runtime security for containers running in Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) environments
  * **NanoEnforcer**: runtime protection of serverless functions
* [Scanner](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/scanner): Used to scan images, VMWare Tanzu applications, and serverless functions locally or stored in a registry

### Aqua Enterprise Self-Hosted edition deployment

Aqua Enterprise Self-Hosted edition requires deploying Aqua server and other components in your datacenter. Here are the server components available:
*  [Server](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/server): core server components â€“ Console, Gateway, and Database. This deployment is mandatory for Aqua Self-Hosted edition. 
*  [Tenant Manager](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/tenant_manager) *(Optional)*: manage multiple segregated Aqua deployments from a single console
*  [CyberCenter](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/cyber_center): required for air-gap environments

Next is deploying Enforcers and Scanners like for the SaaS users.

### Quick Start

A Quick Start option is available for small non-production deployments and quick evaluations. It deploys all Aqua Server and Enforcers, in a single Kubernetes cluster.

# Deployment Methods

You can deploy the mentioned Aqua components using one of the following methods:
* Manifests
* Helm
* Operator
* AWS Cloudformation
* Aquactl (Aqua CLI)
* RPM (for no-orchestrator environments)
* Scripts

Each Aqua component can be deployed through a selection of the methods above, as listed in component's directory itself.

Before you start using the deployment methods in this repository, Aqua strongly recommends you to refer the [Product documentation on Deployments](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/deployment-overview).
