# Enforcers Deployment

Aqua enforcement secures your workloads and infrastructure during runtime. Enforcers are the Aqua components that implement enforcement-related and other functionality. For more information on the Aqua enforcers, refer the product documentation, [Enforcers Overview](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/enforcers-overview) and [Assurance and Enforcement Overview](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/assurance-and-enforcement-overview).

This repository explains different enforcers that can be deployed while setting up your Aqua product. This repository has directory for each enforcer to explain different deployments methods, on the platforms such as Kuberneters, AWS CloudFormation, Openshift, etc.

Following are the enforcers that can be deployed as part of Aqua product deployment:
* [Aqua Enforcer](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/2_enforcers/aqua_enforcer)
* [Kube Enforcer](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/2_enforcers/kube_enforcer)
* [VM Enforcer](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/2_enforcers/VM-Enforcer)
