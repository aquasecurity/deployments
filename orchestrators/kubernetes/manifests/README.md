# Overview

The directories and files in this branch relate to enterprise-grade and advanced deployments of Aqua Enterprise on these Kubernetes platforms:
Kubernetes (native), OpenShift, EKS, GKE, ICP, AKS, TKG, TKGI

Refer to the product documentation for deployment instructions: [Deploy on Kubernetes and OpenShift](https://docs.aquasec.com/v5.3/docs/deploy-on-kubernetes-and-openshift).

Aqua Enterprise deployment in a Kubernetes cluster begins with deployment of the Server components. These include the Server itself, its UI (console), the Aqua Gateway, and database (DB).

You can optionally deploy one or more of each of these components:

- Aqua Enforcers: one deployed per Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet
- Aqua KubeEnforcers: one deployed per Kubernetes cluster as an Admission Controller
- Aqua Scanners: can be deployed at multiple locations in your environment to optimize registry scanning performance and network utilization
