# Deploy Aqua Server using manifests

## Overview
Aqua self-hosted Enterprise product deployment in a Kubernetes cluster begins with deployment of the server, by using multiple manifest yaml files. This component includes the server itself, its UI (console), the Aqua Gateway, and database (DB). You can optionally deploy one or multiple other Aqua components later, as required.

This repository shows all the directories and manifest yaml files required to deploy the Aqua server component on the following Kubernetes platforms:
* Kubernetes 
* OpenShift 
* Kubernetes engines: EKS, GKE, ICP, AKS, TKG, and TKGI

Before you follow the deployment steps explained below, Aqua strongly recommends you refer the product documentation, [Deploy Server Components](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/deploy-k8s-server-components).

## Specific OpenShift notes
The deployment commands shown below use the **kubectl** cli, however they can be easliy replaced with the **oc** cli commands, to work on all platforms including OpenShift.

## Prerequisites
* Your Aqua credentials: username and password
* Your Aqua Enterprise License Token
* Access to the target Kubernetes cluster with RBAC authorization
* The cluster should have a default storage and load-balancer controller. If your cluster does not have these, you should edit the YAML files to configure them as required.

It is recommended that you complete the sizing and capacity assessment for the deployment. Refer to [Sizing Guide](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/sizing-guide).
## Considerations
Before you start deploying Aqua server, you may perform the following configurations, as required.
### Packaged or external managed database
Aqua Enterprise offers packaged PostgreSQL database container. For large environments and enterprise companies with advanced requirements, Aqua recommends to use an external managed PostgreSQL database by following the deployment steps below.
### HTTPS for the Aqua Server
To configure an HTTPS (secure) channel, refer to [Configure HTTPS for the Aqua Server](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/deploy-k8s-configure-https-for-the-aqua-server).
### Active-active Server mode
To configure Active-active Server mode for high availability of Aqua Enterprise, refer to the product documentation, [Deploy Aqua in Active-Active Server Mode](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/deploy-k8s-aqua-in-active-active-server-mode).
### mTLS
To configure mTLS (mutual TLS) instead of the default TLS, refer to the product documentation, [Configure mTLS](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/configure-mtls).
### Run the Server behind a reverse proxy
The Aqua Server container (deployed from the image registry.aquasec.com/console) can be run behind a reverse proxy server such as Apache, NGINX, or HAProxy. To configure this, refer to the product documentation, [Run the Server behind a reverse proxy](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/aqua-server-recommendations#section-run-the-server-behind-a-reverse-proxy).
### Ingress resource
For large environments with more than 500 nodes, you should define a gRPC-supported Ingress to act as a load balancer for multiple Aqua Gateways. To configure this, refer to the product documentation, [Advanced Deployment Architecture](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/advanced-deployment-architecture).

## Pre-deployment
You can skip any of the steps if you have already performed.

**Step 1. Create a namespace (or an OpenShift  project) by name aqua (if not already done).**

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl create namespace aqua
   ```

**Step 2. Create a docker-registry secret (if not already done).**

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl create secret docker-registry aqua-registry \
--docker-server=registry.aquasec.com \
--docker-username=<your-name> \
--docker-password=<your-pword> \
--docker-email=<your-email> \
-n aqua
   ```

**Step 3. Create a service account and RBAC for your deployment platform (if not already done).** Replace the platform name from [Supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_002_RBAC/< PLATFORM >/aqua_sa.yaml
   ```

## Deploy Aqua server using manifests
   
**Step 1. Create the secrets manually or download, edit, and apply the secrets.** It is strongly recommended to change the database password (aqua-db).

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_003_secrets/aqua_secrets.yaml
   ```

**Step 2. Deploy directly or download, edit, and run the deployment configMaps**

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_004_configMaps/aqua_server.yaml
   ```

**Step 3. *(Optional)* Configure the packaged database** (If you use Aqua’s packaged PostgreSQL DB container). 

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_004_configMaps/aqua_db.yaml

   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_005_storage/aqua_db_pvc.yaml
   ```

For large and complex deployments, refer to the product documentation, [Sizing Guide](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/sizing-guide) and [Aqua Packaged DB Operational Guide](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/aqua-packaged-db-operational-guide#section-configure-the-db-environment-size-recommended).

**Step 4. Deploy Aqua server.**

- With Aqua’s packaged DB

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_006_server_deployment/aqua_server_deployment_packaged_db.yaml
   ```

- With external managed DB

   ```SHELL
   $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_006_server_deployment/aqua_server_deployment_managed_db.yaml
   ```

## Expose the Server and Gateway services

You can expose Server and Gateway through one of the three following use cases:

- [Kubernetes LoadBalancer service type](#kubernetes-loadbalancer-service-type-default)
- [Use an Ingress (Envoy) to route traffic to your Gateway farm](#use-an-ingress-envoy)
- [Use an OpenShift route](#use-an-openshift-route)

### Kubernetes LoadBalancer service type

It is a default option. It uses single Gateway service and supports upto 500 hosts. 

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/loadbalancer/aqua_server_gateway_service-lb.yaml
```      

### Use an Ingress (Envoy)

**Step 1. Generate certificates for the Envoy service.**

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/envoy/002_envoy-secrets.yaml
```        
   
**Step 2. Scale the number of Gateways.** Replace *N* with the number of Gateways required.

```SHELL
$ kubectl -n aqua scale --replicas=<N> deployment.apps/aqua-gateway
```

**Step 3. Load the TLS keys and certs as secrets.**

```SHELL
$ kubectl create secret tls aqua-lb-certs --key <<tls-key.key>> --cert <<tls.crt>> -n aqua
```      

**Step 4. Deploy Envoy service.**

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/envoy/001_server_gateway_service-envoy.yaml
```  

**Step 5. Deploy Envoy Configmap.**

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/envoy/003_envoy-configmap.yaml
``` 

**Step 6. Deploy Envoy.**

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/envoy/004_envoy-deployment.yaml
```

### Use an OpenShift route

```SHELL
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/openshift_route/aqua-gateway-route.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/deployments/6.5/server/kubernetes_and_openshift/manifests/aqua_csp_007_networking/openshift_route/aqua-web-route.yaml
```

## Automate Server deployment using Aquactl
Aquactl is the command-line utility to automate the deployment steps mentioned in the section, [Deploy Aqua server using Manifests](#deploy-aqua-server-using-manifests). Command shown in this section creates (downloads) manifests (yaml files) quickly and prepares them for the Aqua Server deployment.

### Command Syntax

```SHELL
aquactl download server [flags]
```

### Flags
You should pass the following deployment options through flags, as required.
