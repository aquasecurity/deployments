## Quick-start deployment of Aqua Enterprise using Helm

The quick-start deployment is used to deploy the Aqua Enterprise Self-Hosted edition in your Kubernetes cluster quickly and easily. It is suited for proofs-of-concept (POCs) and environments intended for instruction, development, and test but not for production environments.

For production usage, enterprise-grade deployments, advanced use cases, and deployment on other Kubernetes platforms, deploy Aqua Enterprise with the required Aqua components (such as server, enforcers, scanner, so on.) on your orchestration platform. For more information, refer to the Product documentation, [Deploy Aqua Enterprise](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/deployment-overview).

Deploy Aqua Enterprise by using the following resources from the aqua-helm repository:

* Clone the aqua-helm git repo
* [Use the aqua-quickstart chart to deploy Aqua Enterprise](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-helm/tree/6.2/aqua-quickstart) and by following the [deployment instructions](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-helm) from the aqua-helm repository

Ensure that you use the latest branch of the Aqua Security Helm repository.
