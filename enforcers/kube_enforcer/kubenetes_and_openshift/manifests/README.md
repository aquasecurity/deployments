## Overview

The Kube Enforcer runs as single replica deployment and provides runtime security for your Kubernetes workloads and infrastructure. Kube enforcer can be deployed in combination with co-requisite Starboard and/or advanced deployment for Pod Enforcer injection. Kube Enforcer(s) can be deployed manually with one of the following combinations per your requirement:

* [Kube enforcer](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/enforcers/kube_enforcer/kubenetes_and_openshift/manifests/kube-enforcer): provides runtime security for your Kubernetes workloads and infrastructure
* [Kube enforcer advanced](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/enforcers/kube_enforcer/kubenetes_and_openshift/manifests/kube_enforcer_advanced): Aqua KubeEnforcer Advanced is a method of deploying Aqua KubeEnforcer in a special advanced configuration for Pod Enforcer injection.
* [Kube enforcer starboard](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/enforcers/kube_enforcer/kubenetes_and_openshift/manifests/kube_enforcer_starboard): Starboard is an Aqua Security open-source tool that increases the effectiveness of Kubernetes security. Starboard is deployed by default, when you deploy KubeEnforcer to assess workload compliance throughout the lifecycle of the workloads
* [Kube enforcer advanced starboard](https://github.com/KoppulaRajender/deployments/tree/6.5_dev/enforcers/kube_enforcer/kubenetes_and_openshift/manifests/kube_enforcer_advanced_starboard): Aqua KubeEnforcer Advanced Starboard is the Aqua KubeEnforcer component with Starboard capability deployed in a special advanced configuration.
