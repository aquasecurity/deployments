## Deploy Aqua Enforcer using Helm

You can deploy Aqua Enforcer for both the Aqua SaaS and Self-Hosted Enterprise editions in your Kubernetes cluster, using the [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/). Through this method, Aqua Enforcer is deployed on all Kubernetes cluster nodes by using a Helm chart. This Helm chart deploys a single Aqua Enforcer container automatically on each node in your cluster. Use the following resources from the aqua-helm repository:

* Clone the aqua-helm git repo or add [Aqua Helm private repository](https://helm.aquasec.com)
* [Install Aqua Enforcer using helm charts](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-helm/tree/6.2/enforcer#installing-the-chart)

Ensure that you use the latest branch of the Aqua Security Helm repository.
