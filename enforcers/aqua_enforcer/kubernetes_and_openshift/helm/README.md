# Deploy Aqua Enforcer using Helm

You can deploy Aqua Enforcer in your Kubernetes cluster, using the Helm charts. Through this method, Aqua Enforcer is deployed on all Kubernetes cluster nodes. This Helm chart deploys a single Aqua Enforcer container automatically on each node in your cluster. 

For deployment instructions, refer to the [aqua-helm repository](https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-helm/tree/2022.4/enforcer#installing-the-chart).

Ensure that you use the latest branch of the Aqua Security Helm repository.
