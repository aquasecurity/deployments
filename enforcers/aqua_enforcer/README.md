## Overview

Aqua enforcer provides full runtime protection and other functionality for containers, as well as selected host-related functionality. The Aqua enforcer, running as a DaemonSet deployment, provides runtime security for your Kubernetes workloads by blocking unauthorized deployments, monitoring and restricting runtime activities, and generating audit events for your review. Aqua enforcer is supported on the Linux and Windows platforms. Deployment of Aqua enforcer is optional. A single Aqua Enforcer can be deployed per Kubernetes node (or non-Kubernetes host). For more information, refer the product documentation, [Enforcers Overview](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/enforcers-overview#section-aqua-enforcers) and [Aqua Enforcer](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/aqua-enforcer).
